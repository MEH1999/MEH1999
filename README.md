## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
# Hello, I'm Mohammed E. Hossain, 

<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mhossa99/"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-LinkedIn-0072b1?&style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white" /></a>

Recent Graduate from Towson University with a B.S. Information Technology Degree. I have a passion for Quality Assurance. Data Analysis, and Information Technology with an interest in cybersecurity & system administration work. I started as an IT Analyst intern at Helping Hand for Relief & Development, where I truly applied my skills from my degree to then translate to my next role. I then started working at TEKsystems on a contract with Venable LLP, where I gained invaluable insights into how a law firm's IT operates. I started as a Service Desk Analyst & then was promoted to Senior IT Analyst, where I did data analysis reporting on worker productivity and process improvement. Including, training new team members and updating learning material.
Currently, Working at COOP as  a Data Analytics Captain as a Former Alumni, I participated in the program where I gained meaningful connections in the Data Industry paired with the ad agency space.

## Objective

My Journey in Information technology has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, data analysis, and quality assurance. I am now eager to transition into any of those fields as most of the skills in each position go hand in hand, specifically aiming to join as a System Admin, Business/Data Analyst, or Quality Assurance Tester. If anything, I would like to ultimately combine each skill from each path to coincide into one role to better my chances of being impactful in my day to day. As each role has skill sets that will tie in with each other. Currently, ðŸš§ Under Construction ðŸš§ in terms of detailing out my projects and finalizing them in a way, where it is easily digestible.
